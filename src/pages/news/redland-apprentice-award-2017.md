We are delighted to congratulate Tom Knight, a RoofTrain apprentice, on his Highly Commended Award at Redland Apprentice of the Year, 2017. Tom was chosen as one of country's best roofing apprentices after two days of intense competition.

> it boosted my confidence and taught me the skills I need to run my own business

The competition is challenging but rewarding, and introduces competitors to other sides of the industry which Tom knows will further his career.

> the competition was brilliant; it really stretched the lads
<cite>Alan Lander, RoofTrain</cite>

Tutor Alan Lander of the South West Roof Training Group, said the competition is the first of its kind in the roofing sector and a boost to all the contestants.

> we couldn't deliver training without Redland's support. It's priceless.
<cite>Alan Lander, RoofTrain</cite>

The competition peaked with the Apprentice of the Year Awards Dinner attended by the ten finalists, their tutors, employers, and judges. Tom returned home with a bag full of trade tools and a promise of a lifetime supply of free-of-charge courses at the Redland National Training Centre.

Our thanks also go to Tom's employer, Nathan Wheeler of Wheeler Roofing Services in Truro, for his support in this prestigious event.
