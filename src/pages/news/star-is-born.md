Our warmest congratulations to former soldier, Tom Thompson, the winner of the Rising Star category in the [2018 RCI Pitched Roofing Awards](https://www.pitchedroofingawards.co.uk/). This is Tom's second success of the year, having been Highly Commended in the pitched roofing category of the [BMI Redland Apprentice of the Year](https://redland.co.uk/apprentice-of-the-year-2018) competition in June.

> he will be an inspiration and an asset to the roofing industry
<cite>Alan Lander</cite>

After a traumatic time in Afghanistan, Tom's army career ended and he became an apprentice with [AL King Roofing](http://www.alkingroofing.co.uk/). His new roofing skills were taught from Alan Lander of [RoofTrain]([root]).

Tom proved to be an able roofer and progressed rapidly achieving second in the national [2017 SkillBuild finals]([root]news/skillbuild-final-2017/) with a judge's commendation. He now works for [Roundway Roofing](https://www.roundwayroofing.co.uk/) in Devizes which specialises in heritage work.

Alan commented:

"I believe Tom has designs on becoming an assessor and has registered on a training course with the help of the South West Roofing Training Group. Once Tom has experience in assessing, a natural progression would be a role in teaching. His skills from his army days would certainly put him in good stead. Whichever route Tom chooses to take in the future, he will be an inspiration and an asset to the roofing industry."
