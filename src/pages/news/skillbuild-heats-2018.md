This year's apprentice Tyler Mason took part in the SkillBuild 2018 heats held at South Devon College, Paignton. The well-hosted event was supported by roofing industry suppliers, along with local businesses, and a sprinkling of celebrities!

Our thanks go to South Devon College for their generous hospitality and also Rowsell Roofing Ltd of Yeovil for the support given to their employee, Tyler.

We are waiting with baited breath to see if he can reach this year's final in November. Good luck Tyler!
