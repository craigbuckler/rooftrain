Many congratulations to Ryan Holland and Tom Thompson of the South West Roofing Training Group who both took part in the National Final of SkillBuild for roofing at the NEC Birmingham on 15-19 November 2017.

Ryan of Wheeler Roofing Ltd, Truro and Tom of A L King Roofing Ltd, Melksham gained a place in the final to compete against six other competitors from around the UK. Tom Thompson was awarded a Silver Medal.

Our sincere thanks go to the employers for supporting their lads through the heats and finals, along with the organisers and judges for putting on a great competition.

> I hope current apprentices coming through their training take inspiration from this year's competition and take part next year

Both Ryan and Tom said the competition was a great way to show off their skills. They really enjoyed being involved even though the two and a half days were intense, both physically and mentally.
