We all know how important it is to keep safe on site, which is why we are now delivering the [NOCN](https://www.nocn.org.uk/) qualification in the ["*Safe Use of Cut-Off Saws including Abrasive Wheels*" course]([root]roof-training-courses/cut-off-saw/) as part of the current assured short courses offered via the SiteRight brand.

The course is delivered by our qualified and approved trainer and is a blend of theoretical and practical hands-on study supplemented by NOCN-approved training material. Delegate's knowledge is assessed at the beginning of the course through an initial assessment paper and is formally tested at the end of the basic course through a practical observation and a multiple choice examination paper. The course is pass / fail with pass certificate being valid for 5 years.

The half day course looks at:

* The Legal Requirements for the use of Petrol Driven Cut-Off Saw including HASAWA, PUWER and COSHH Regulations.

* Checking the machine and selecting the correct blade/wheel/PPE.

* Fuelling, starting and hands-on experience in the safe use of the machine.

* In addition, the course demonstrates the use of other machines including fuel injection, battery and brake machines.

* Use of accessories to improve efficiency and easy handling.

The course attracts a [CITB](https://www.citb.co.uk/) grant for its members, so [get in contact]([root]contact-us/) to book your place.
