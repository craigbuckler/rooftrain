> This course is going to help make estimating a lot simpler. Alan is a very knowledgeable teacher.
<cite>Leon Cumming</cite>

Leon Cumming and Carl Harris recently travelled from Eastbourne to Exeter to attend our two-day [estimating course]([root]roof-training-courses/roof-estimating/).

Having been an SME for more than 40 years, Alan Lander is acutely aware how precious time is for small businesses. There never seem to be enough hours in the day, and was happy to help by holding the course over a weekend.
