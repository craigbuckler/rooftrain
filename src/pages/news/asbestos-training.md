We've all heard the word "*asbestos*", but do you know that over 5,000 people die from asbestos related illness in the UK every year? Understanding the dangers of asbestos is especially important for those working in the construction and roofing industries.

We are pleased to announce that Clive Chamberlain from Wiltshire based M4 Property Solutions Limited has recently audited and approved Alan to deliver [UKATA](https://www.ukata.org.uk/)-certificated [asbestos awareness training (CAT A)]([root]roof-training-courses/asbestos-awareness/) in the South West as an approved trainer for M4 Property Solutions.

Clive and M4 Property Solutions have been a UKATA member for more than 10 years and has been delivering asbestos-related training for 12 years. He is well versed in explaining the dangers to his clients and sat on the UKATA board of Directors from 2015 to 2017.

However, the UKATA Asbestos Awareness course is not enough to work with any forms of asbestos because it does not meet the legal requirements laid down under Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012. This is why Alan is working with M4 Property Solutions and is very near to gaining approval to deliver non-licensed training (CAT B) and refresher training in the South West.

Please [contact us]([root]contact-us/) for [further information about the asbestos course]([root]roof-training-courses/asbestos-awareness/) or to book your place.
