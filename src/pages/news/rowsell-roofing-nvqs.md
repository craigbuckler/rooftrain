[Rowsell Roofing](https://www.rowsellroofing.com/), a long-established Somerset-based roofing company would like to say a massive congratulations to newly-qualified Zac Hopkins, Tyler Mason and Sam Ellis. All three delegates successfully completed their Specialist Applied-Skills Programme (SAP) and gained a Level 2 QCF NVQ Diploma in Roofing Occupations, Roof Slater and Tiler.

Peter Rowsell, the company director acknowledged the hard work and dedication each apprentice had put in to earn their academic qualification in roofing:

"They learnt the practical techniques and theoretical knowledge of how to use plain and interlocking tiles, natural slates and other materials to cover valleys, hips and general areas. These core areas have been supplemented by their completion of qualifications in First Aid and Health and Safety, along with other industry-specific subjects."

Peter went on to say each delegate has also gained over three years of professional technical experience on-site within this time.

Peter acknowledges that thanks has to be given to the senior staff at Rowsell for their part in Zac's, Tyler's and Sam's achievement:

"Without constant mentoring and support on-site from Rowsell's experienced workforce, the on-site learning element of the boys NVQ would not be achievable."

This specialist roofing training is delivered by Alan Lander of RoofTrain, who delivers the apprenticeship programme on behalf of the CITB through the South West Roofing Training Group. Alan agrees with Peter:

"It's great to see experienced people willing to nurture and hone the skills of the emerging workforce. Without this commitment, so much valuable knowledge would be lost forever."

Gaining his NVQ is especially poignant for Tyler Mason who made it to the SkillBuild finals in 2018. Unfortunately, Tyler had to withdraw from the competition due to an injured ankle:

"I found college an extremely enjoyable experience and was able to take time and learn the skills needed to progress myself. These skills have translated into more efficient and higher standards of work than I was producing before."

The success of all three apprentices demonstrates how Rowsell Roofing has got it right. Training investment for an emerging workforce helps sustain a level of professional expertise within the company and the roofing industry. Sam agrees:

> my confidence in all areas of roofing has improved
<cite>Sam Ellis</cite>

"I feel the apprenticeship has benefited me in all areas of my work. I learnt new and more practical ways of roofing, making day to day tasks easier. After completion of the apprenticeship my confidence in all areas of roofing has improved due to the skills I've learnt on the course."

Zac went on to say:

> working on site and combining the teaching from the course has improved my knowledge and practical skills
<cite>Zac Hopkins</cite>

"I am very pleased to have completed my apprenticeship, working on site and combining the teaching from the course has improved my knowledge and practical skills massively. I have also been working very hard in a team and on my confidence. It has been enjoyable."

The apprentices are proud of their achievement and recognise the positive impact it has already had on their work. Peter is looking forward to witnessing their continued progress and has already welcomed the next apprentice by enrolling him on the September 2019 SAP in Exeter!
