> competitors are of a tremendously high standard this year
<cite>Simon Dixon, SkillBuild judge</cite>

More than 600 roofing trainees and apprentices competed in SkillBuild National Final over three days at Birmingham NEC in December 2015.

Specialist Apprentices Dan Prudham of Marnick Roofing and Jack Newton of Wheeler Roofing Services gave their all. They were rewarded with "Highly Commended" medals.

> I wish them every success for a future in roof slating and tiling

We would like to express thanks to Dan and Jack's employers, Marnick Roofing and Wheeler Roofing Services, for granting the lads time to compete in this year's heats and the final. Thanks to both Dan and Jack for their tremendous efforts.
