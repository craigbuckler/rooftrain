We are pleased to announce we shall be starting another [Pitched Roofing Specialist Apprentice Programme]([root]roof-training-courses/pitched-roofing/) in April 2013. This 24-month course consists of 23 days off-site training at our roofing training centre in Exeter. It concludes with the NVQ assessment through the on-site assessment training route. The course is **fully funded by ConstructionSkills** for all employers who are levy registered and meet grant requirements.

The programme has been running for several years. It has been highly successful and produces confident, NVQ-qualified roofers with skills in the following aspects of pitched roofing:

* employment rights and responsibilities
* pitched roofing terminology, materials, components, battens and membranes
* natural slating
* plain and interlocking tiles
* shingles
* man-made fibre cement slates
* lead dressing, and
* solar panel installation

The following general health and safety training is also included:

* working at height
* asbestos awareness
* abrasive wheels
* manual handling
* emergency first aid
* fire safety
