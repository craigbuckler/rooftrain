Alan Lander bids a fond farewell to another group of pitched roofing apprentices who have successfully completed the Specialist Applied-Skills Programme (SAP - formerly Specialist Apprentice Skills Programme).

Alan was the first trainer to teach the pitched roofing SAP course back in 2011 having written the original programme. Since that time, the SAP courses have gone from strength to strength. A significant number of roofing employers return and sign-up new learners every year. The opening of a second training centre in Melksham, Wiltshire has increased SAP course popularity and availability. A number of new companies have been brought to the [South West Roofing Training Group](http://www.swrtg.co.uk/).

Alan would like to take this opportunity to thank all roofing employers for their continued support and extends a warm welcome to new members.
