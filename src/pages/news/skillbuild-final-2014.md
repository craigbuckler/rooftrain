Congratulations to Sean Keenor for winning a Silver medal in the SkillBuild 2014 final held in November at the Birmingham NEC.

> the standard of work produced in the competition was to a very high standard again this year
<cite>Simon Dixon, SkillBuild judge</cite>

Sean competed against seven other roofers from around the UK over three days of competition. He showed an outstanding level of skill to finish in the Silver medal position.

Sean was taught by Alan Lander at RoofTrain. He put a lot of work into his learning and always produced a good standard of work. We wish Sean every success in his roofing career. Thanks also to his employer, Rob Siddall of RoofSmart - another RoofTrain graduate!
