*He's done it again!*

Another pair of RoofTrain apprentices have qualified for the Skillbuild finals in November 2016. This follows success in the South West Heat of the national competition for young slaters and tilers. Tom Knight of Wheeler Roofing Services Ltd and Lee Dowding of Dylan Faber Roofing Ltd have both qualified for the national final.

The SkillBuild final forms a part of the Skills Show, the nation's largest skills and careers event. It gives competitors and the roofing industry a greater platform in which to showcase the best of roofing talent in the UK.
