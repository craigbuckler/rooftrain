The final is managed by [CITB](https://www.citb.co.uk/) with each craft being involved in organising the competition for its trade. [NFRC](https://www.nfrc.co.uk/) run the roofing competition and have close ties with the [Worshipful Company of Tylers and Bricklayers](https://www.tylersandbricklayers.co.uk/) which was established in 1416.

The winner will be invited to London to attend the annual Craft Awards lunch as well as participating in the IFD World Championship in 2020.

We wish Tyler the best of luck and hope he makes it all the way!
