> this is another great achievement for a RoofTrain apprentice roofer
<cite>Alan Lander, RoofTrain</cite>

Congratulations Nick Davey, apprentice to [RoofSmart in mid-Devon](http://www.roofsmartdevon.co.uk/), who was one of the highest-scoring competitors at this year's [SkillBuild 2019](https://www.goconstruct.org/construction-today/skillbuild/) regional qualifiers. Nick has now been invited to compete in the SkillBuild UK National Final 2019, which will be held at the Birmingham NEC on 21&ndash;23 November 2019.

Alan Lander of RoofTrain, Nick's tutor and mentor, commented:

_"In addition to participating in the BMI Redland Young Roofer of the Year Awards earlier in early 2019, this is another great achievement for Nick. I am delighted his hard work and diligence has paid off and wish him the best of luck at the finals in November."_

Nick's employer, Rob Siddall, of RoofSmart is no stranger to Skillbuild and had an apprentice gain second place in 2014.

Our thanks go to the [South West Roofing Training Group](http://www.swrtg.co.uk/) and Rob Siddall for their continued and valued support.
