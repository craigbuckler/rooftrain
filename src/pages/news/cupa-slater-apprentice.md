Congratulations are in order to Emiljano Mujac who has been awarded the Cupa Natural Slate Apprentice of the Year 2022.

Emiljano carried out a Specialist Applied-Skills Programme (SAP) in roof slating and tiling, gaining an NVQ Level 2. He was trained by Alan Lander of Rooftrain on behalf of the [South West Roofing Training Group](http://www.swrtg.co.uk/).

Alan said: "*Emilijano did very well on his slating and tiling course, always tried his best, and had a thirst for knowledge.*"

Being Greek, Emiljano had to return to Greece to complete his national service at the end of the course.

It was Alan's intention to enter Emiljano into the BMI Apprentice of the Year and SkillBuild. He would have enjoyed these and done well but, unfortunately, both competitions were held while he was away.

A much-deserved accolade for a very committed young man.
