*And theyâ€™re OFF!...*

...to the apprentice roofers' SkillBuild heats in St Austell, Cornwall.

Having had apprentices competing in the heats and national final for several years, RoofTrain has entered the 2017 SkillBuild competition.

> we wish both apprentices the very best of luck and hope they enjoy the experience
<cite>Tom Thompson</cite>

Two candidates have been put forward to compete in the SkillBuild heats held in St Austell on 15 June 2017. Our candidates are Ryan Holland of Wheeler Roofing in Truro and Tom Thompson of A L King Roofing in Melksham. The lads know they need to work hard to gain a place in the final to be held later in the year.

Our thanks must go to the employers who, once again, have stepped up to give their support to the lads.
