A big thank you to the [South West Roofing Training Group](http://www.swrtg.co.uk/) for supplying hoodies to the latest intake of specialist apprentices on the pitched roofing skills course. The course is being held at the SWRTG training centre in Melksham; the third slating and tiling course to be held there since the it opened in 2018.

Alan Lander, RoofTrain's expert roofing trainer, is currently running three courses in Melksham and two in Exeter. Another course will be started in Exeter during June 2019.

All apprentices learn how to install natural slates, cement man-made fibre slates, concrete interlocking single lap tiles, plain tiles, and shingles, basic lead dressing skills, and use and preparation of mortar, all to industry standards of competence. The training enables apprentice roofers to make a positive contribution on site and become a valued asset to your roofing business.

We urge all employers looking to qualify roofers to NVQ Level 2 to come on board the RoofTrain!
