Using his many years of experience as a roofing contractor, Alan Lander has developed a roof estimating course.

The course, originally designed to give merchants an understanding of producing quantity lists and estimating from customers' plans, aims to break down the mystique of architects' drawings.

The two-day course is delivered at our roofing training centre in a straight-forward, easy-to-understand manner.


## Course content

Training course content includes:

* terminology and design
* how to use a scale rule
* measuring simple and complex shapes
* creating material and quantity lists.

Although intended for merchants, the course would benefit roofing and building contractors looking to improve on their knowledge and confidence in an important part of their business.


## Training course dates and venue

Roofing courses are held at our [dedicated roof training centre in Exeter, Devon]([root]about-us/roof-training-centre/). Please [contact us]([root]contact-us/) to arrange your lessons.
