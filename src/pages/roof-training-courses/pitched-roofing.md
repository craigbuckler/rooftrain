The Specialist Applied-Skills Programme (SAP) is an 18-month apprenticeship scheme leading to an NVQ Level 2 in Roof Slating & Tiling and Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) recognition following successfully completion of a health and safety test.

The course comprises of roof training modules delivered through a combination of formal off-the-job training sessions (23 days) and supervised on-site training with an employer where the final end assessment will be carried out by an industry-approved Assessor.
