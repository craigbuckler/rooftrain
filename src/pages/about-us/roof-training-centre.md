All off-site roofing lessons are conducted in our dedicated roofing course training centre near Exeter in Devon. The centre provides a safe, warm environment for novice or professional roofers and enables them to learn quickly and effectively. They can concentrate on learning new roofing skills without the worry of heights or adverse weather conditions.

Our custom-built roof training facilities beat other roof training centres because they were designed and constructed by Alan Lander, a professional roofer with more than 40 years experience in the roofing industry.
