For the past 30 years Alan has run Roofcraft (Exeter) Ltd, a successful roofing company based in Exeter, Devon. Since 2001, Alan has been involved in roof training and assessing. He has taught slating, tiling and assessing at NVQ Levels 2 and 3 for the [South Wales & South West Roofing Training Group](http://www.swrtg.co.uk/).

> Employers should be made more aware of the benefits of the continual skills development of their operatives

The roof training options have been extended to include lead dressing and welding, roof window installations, solar thermal and photovoltaic installations (from the roofing aspect) as well as on-site courses.

Alan now devotes his time to developing and delivering roof training courses to both apprentices and more experienced roofers.

*Will your roofers be next to climb on board the RoofTrain?!*
