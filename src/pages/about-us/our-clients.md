RoofTrain UK have trained apprentice and experienced roofing professionals from a variety of small, medium and large corporations.

**South Wales & South West Roofing Training Group**

> Alan Lander has been associated with the South Wales & South West Roofing Training Group since 2001 as an NVQ Assessor and a roof training provider. The quality and standard of his services ensure that the association continues long into the future, to the benefit of both organisations.

**O'Brien Roofing &amp; Leadwork Ltd**

> It is important to O'Brien Roofing & Leadworks Ltd to provide the highest possible level of workmanship on all works undertaken. I am very happy that our roofers have the opportunity to maintain and develop their knowledge and skills by taking specialist training courses provided. RoofTrain UK courses have enabled us to provide the exceptional quality of work on site which has gained us several awards recognising this.
